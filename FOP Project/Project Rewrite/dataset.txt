all datasets:

    all coordinates follow (x,y) formatting

    worldLimits = (maxX,maxY)

    wallOrientation:
        0 : horizontal
        1 : vertical

World.create_wall function should return
    [orientation],[(wallStart)...(wallEnd)]

    from there, in main.py append wallNumber to key and turn to tuple

walls formatting:
    {(orientation,wallNumber) : [(start),...(end)],(orientation2,wallNumber2) : [(start2),...(end2)]}

items formatting:
    [(item1),(item2)...]

walls:
    walls have a x% chance of changing, meaning that they randomly regenerate
    if the walls regenerate and fall on top of a human, they instantly die
